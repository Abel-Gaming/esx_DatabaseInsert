# esx_DatabaseInsert

This was created for use on my server, PrimeRP, for adding trailers to the database as owned, as well as storing them in garages. Use this however you want and modify it in anyway you want.

## No Support
I will not be supporting anything on this script. If you want to use the base or code out of it, feel free. However, I will not provide support.
